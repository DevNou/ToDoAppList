Save Tasks: Changes can be saved back to the task list.

Delete Tasks: Remove individual tasks from the list.

Mark Complete: Tasks can be marked as completed, visually crossing them out.

Clear All / Mark All Complete: Buttons to manage multiple tasks at once.

Task Filtering: Filter tasks by All, Completed, or Pending status.

Task Count: Displays the total number of tasks dynamically.

Responsive UI: Built with Bootstrap for a clean and mobile-friendly layout.

Notifications: Success and error messages are shown when tasks are added or invalid input is submitted.

Technologies used:

Angular 18+ (standalone components, signals)

Bootstrap 5 for styling and responsive layout

Custom CSS for enhanced UI (orange border for editing, crossed-out completed tasks)

Angular Pipes for task filtering
